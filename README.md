# LoRa-Gateway-Node-Network
Materials related to the Gateway/Node soil moisture data logging network developed USDA ARS researchers in 2017.

This repository contains materials related to the wireless Gateway and Node soil moisture data logging network developed by USDA ARS researchers at the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC) in 2017 for the Conservation Innovation Grant (CIG) Cover Crop Project. This project is in collaboration with North Carolina State University, University of Georgia Athena, the University of Maryland College Park and with private growers along the East Coast.

The project aims to improve and develop new decision support tools for effective cover crop adoption by collecting soil water and nitrogen data from on-farm experimental sites. A low-cost data logging system using Arduino-based microcontrollers and LoRa TM radio transceivers was developed to collect and store hourly data from SDI-12 soil moisture sensors installed at various depths in the soil profile. 

The wireless Gateway-Node network sends data from the Nodes in the plots to a central receiver or Gateway outside the plots to limit soil compaction and plant damage in the experimental plots caused by repeated traffic. A Blueooth radio is included on the gateway to allow for wireless download of data.
